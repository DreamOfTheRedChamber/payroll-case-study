Payroll Case Study
==================

This is my implementation of the Payroll Case Study from the book Agile Software
Development by Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. Uncle Bob).

Implementation details
----------------------

It's written in Java, using JUnit 4.10 and Hamcrest 1.x for testing, Maven 3.x for dependency management.
